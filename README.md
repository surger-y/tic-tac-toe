# Tic Tac Toe

A simple player vs comp Tic Tac Toe game for the command line, written in Javascript, and using prompt-sync for user input.

This was an attempt at a functional programming style, although I realize its not perfect (there are a few global variables, which could have been returned from functions and passed as arguments).
